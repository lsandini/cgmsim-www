Modeling exercise
=================

Physical activity of various intensity affects glucose homeastasis in many ways. Intense activity triggers adrenaline release which increases the EGP transiently, while the muscles oxidize their own glycogen stores. There is an initial steep rise in BG.

Less intense activity increases the Peripheral Glucose Uptake (PGU) and the BG will start to decline after 15-30 min.

If physical activity continues, the PGU remains higher also in the post-exercise state, as the muscles replenish their glycogen stores for the next time they will be required.

Quantifying activity requires motion sensors, heart rate sensors, etc... There is work in progress not yet described here, mainly involving smart watches counting steps and heart rate. 

**Modeling physical activity is not included in this currentt version of the simulation**.
