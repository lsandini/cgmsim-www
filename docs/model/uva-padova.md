We encourage you to visit the website of the <a href="https://lt1.org/" target="_blank">University of Applied Sciences of Ulm, where the LoopInsight1 open-source AID simulator project</a> is presented and open to public access. In contrary to CGMSIM v.3, LT1 uses a scenario-based approach, but it also combines automated insulin dosing (AID) solutions to "treat" the simulated subjects.

The UVA/Padova Diabetes Model, also known as the University of Virginia/Padova Diabetes Model, is a mathematical model developed to simulate type 1 diabetes (T1D) in individuals. 

The UVA/Padova Diabetes Model takes into account various factors such as insulin secretion, glucose absorption, insulin sensitivity, and other physiological parameters to estimate blood glucose levels and assess the progression of T1D over time (minutes/hours). It can be used to simulate different scenarios and interventions, evaluate treatment strategies.

The model has been utilized in research studies and clinical trials to gain insights into T1D pathophysiology, assess the impact of various interventions like insulin therapy and artificial pancreas systems, and inform the development of new treatment strategies. Its use contributes to advancing our understanding of T1D and improving patient care.
