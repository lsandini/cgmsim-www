# Random Noise 
Some level of "randomness" is added to CGMSIM's calculations. It represents the fine BG variations due to physical activity, erratically absorbing insulin and carbs, emotions and counter-regulative hormones, glucose sensor imprecisions, etc... This is completly empiric and we suggest you keep to the suggested values. However, you are free to experiment with different values.
