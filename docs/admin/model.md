# Model
CGMSIM is based on a very simplified model of human physiology, certainly not a precise or validated one. We have included a modified version of the UVA/Padova physiological model (without glucagon modeling) as an alternative model. 

Be aware that this model require a lot of specific subject parameters and for now only one subject is modeled. This UVA/Padova simulation initiates in a steady state in "insulin pump mode" and ignores any long-acting insulin agonist entries or superimposed noise. It is here for testing purposes only.
