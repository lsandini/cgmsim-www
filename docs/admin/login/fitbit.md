Fitbit is the method of choice for account creation and authentication in CGMSIM. When signing in using your Fitbit<sup>Â®</sup> credentials, you allow CGMSIM to retrieve data about your physical activity from the Fitbit Web API. <u>However, CGMSIM will retrieve your data only after you specify it separately</u>.

While the Fitbit application in your cell phone uploads data to the Fitbit server about every 15 minutes, we retrieve data every 5 minutes in order to always obtain the most recent data.

Your data is then formatted and sent to the Nightscout webpage, where it is stored along to your CGM values and treatment entries (insulins, meals).
