# Kickstart 
For CGMSIM to start its calculations, you'll need 3 initial sensor glucose values. CGMSIM bases its calculations on the impact of Insulin on board, Carbs on board, Endogenous Glucose Production and Physical activity. The produces a "difference" or "delta", applied on the last repoted value. 

The Kickstarter can be re-used later to re-initiate the simulation.
