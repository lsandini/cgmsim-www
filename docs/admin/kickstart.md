# Kickstart 

For CGMSIM to start its calculations, you'll need 3 initial sensor glucose values. 

CGMSIM bases its calculations on the impact of Insulin on board (IOB), Carbs on board (COB), Endogenous Glucose Production (EGP) and Physical activity (PA). 

The product is a "difference" or "delta", applied on the last reported value.

The Kickstarter can be re-used later to re-initiate the simulation.
