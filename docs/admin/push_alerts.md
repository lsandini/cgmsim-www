# Push Alerts

Push alerts require the use of our CGMSIM mobile app, **they are not operative in the standalone mobile profile !**
## Apple iOS and watchOS

The CGMSIM mobile app for iOS requires Testflight to be installed on your iPhone. Get it from the AppStore.
Testflight is Apple's official app for distributing iOS applications for testing purposes.

Press "Add notifications to this device" to receive push notifications. This feature is device-specific, anc it can be disabled any time.
