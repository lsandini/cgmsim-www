With Testflight installed, [request an invitation from one of the developers here !](../contact/contact.md) 

When requesting an invitation, <u>indicate the email address used as your Apple ID.</u> Once your request is accepted, <b>cgmsim-app</b> will be visible in Testflight and valid for 90 days. 

You'll be prompted to install, update or open your app. Notice the expiration date ! A new version will be deployed every 90 days and you'll be prompted update your app. 

A maximum number of 100 users is allowed when distributing our application with Testflight, so be patient. We'll try to increase this number if the amount of requests requires it.
