!!! danger "Coffee ... :coffee:"
    This project was not funded in any way and was written completely during our free time. It required quite some coffee, working late at night. 
    
    During the initial testing phase, there were substantial costs for hosting the main website, and numerous Nightscout instances. We reduced these costs to the minimum, but some developer licences are required for producing and distributing the mobile app, registering the domain names, etc...
